  abstract={This paper examines how household location decisions differentially affect labor market outcomes across gender and partnership status using French administrative data. Implementing a staggered difference-in-difference design, I find that only partnered women experience income losses following moves, with earnings declining by approximately 7\% in the two years post-relocation. Analysis of within-household dynamics reveals that moves typically reduce total household income and disproportionately benefit men's careers --even in couples where women were the primary earners pre-move. These findings are not consistent with income-maximizing models of household decision-making that predict prioritization of the higher earner's career. Instead, the results suggest that gender norms play a crucial role in household location choices, with men's career opportunities systematically prioritized over women's, regardless of their relative economic contributions.},

  abstract={TThis paper studies the gender gap in the urban wage premium and its heterogeneity by couple and parental status. Using administrative data on the universe of French residents, I find that the urban wage premium is 50\% larger for women than men once spatial sorting is accounted for. Contrary to expectations, this gender gap is not driven by partnered women or mothers benefiting more from density. Instead, mothers of young children experience a density penalty that nearly eliminates their additional agglomeration gains, suggesting a large role of congestion cost. I also find a positive effect of density on labor market participation that is stronger for women than men after controlling for sorting, and is not related to household structure.},
