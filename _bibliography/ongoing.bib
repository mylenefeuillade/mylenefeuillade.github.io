  abstract={This paper examines how household location decisions differentially affect labor market outcomes across gender and partnership status using French administrative data. Implementing a staggered difference-in-difference design, I find that only partnered women experience income losses following moves, with earnings declining by approximately 7\% in the two years post-relocation. Analysis of within-household dynamics reveals that moves typically reduce total household income and disproportionately benefit men's careers --even in couples where women were the primary earners pre-move. These findings are not consistent with income-maximizing models of household decision-making that predict prioritization of the higher earner's career. Instead, the results suggest that gender norms play a crucial role in household location choices, with men's career opportunities systematically prioritized over women's, regardless of their relative economic contributions.},

  title={Gender and the city: decomposing the gender gap in the urban wage premium},
  prevtitle={(previously "Households, gender and agglomeration economies")},
  author={Feuillade, Mylène},
  abstract={The existence of an urban wage premium has been largely established by the urban economics literature. However, despite many potential mechanism, there is no consensus on its heterogeneity by gender. In this paper, I adapt the standard two-step approach to estimate the urban wage premium by gender and marital status. I find that women benefit 50\% more than men from city density in terms of income. I also document that women experience a higher "big city employment premium": their probability of being unemployed decreases 50\% more with density than men’s. Finally, I show that these elasticities are not significantly different for married women than for single ones.},
