  author={Feuillade, Mylène},
  abstract={This paper examines how household location decisions differentially affect labor market outcomes across gender and partnership status. Implementing a staggered difference-in-difference design with French administrative data, I find that only coupled women experience income losses following moves: their earnings decline by approximately 7\% in the two years post-relocation before they recover. Moves typically reduce total household income and disproportionately benefit men's careers --even in couples where women were the primary earners pre-move. These findings are not consistent with income-maximizing models of household decision-making that predict prioritization of the higher earner's career. Instead, the results suggest that gender norms play a crucial role in household location choices, with men's career opportunities being systematically prioritized over women's, regardless of their relative economic contributions.},

  prevtitle={(previously "Households, gender and agglomeration economies")},
  author={Feuillade, Mylène},
  abstract={This paper studies the gender gap in the urban wage premium and its heterogeneity by couple and parental status. Using administrative data on the universe of French residents, I find that the urban wage premium is 30 to 50\% larger for women than men once spatial sorting is accounted for. Contrary to expectations, this gender gap is not driven by partnered women or mothers benefiting more from density. Instead, mothers of young children experience a density penalty that nearly eliminates their additional agglomeration gains, suggesting a large role of congestion costs interacting with childcare constraints. I also find a positive effect of density on labor market participation that is stronger for women than men after controlling for sorting, and is not related to household structure.},

  title={The rise in work from home and spousal labor supply},
  author={Feuillade, Mylène, and Goux, Dominique, and Maurin, Eric},
  abstract={This article explores how an employee's choice to work from home (WFH) influences his or her spouse's outcomes. Drawing on the specific features of the French experience, we show that a spouse's switch to WFH leads to a sharp increase in the probability that his or her partner will also switch to WFH, as well as in the number of hours worked by the partner. These cross-effects are particularly strong for men, who seem to primarily condition their decision to work from home on that of their partner. The effects of WFH on the volume of hours worked are greatly underestimated when spillovers within couples are neglected. },
